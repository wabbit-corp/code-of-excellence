# Code of Excellence – FAQ

### 1. **What is the difference between the Code of Excellence and a typical Code of Conduct?**

Typical Codes of Conduct (CoC) may emphasize inclusivity by explicitly naming protected groups, listing detailed “do’s and don’ts,” or prescribing enforcement committees. The **Code of Excellence** keeps the focus on **technical merit, individual accountability, and minimal bureaucracy**. We still ban harassment and personal attacks, but we do so by calling for professional, rational discourse rather than categorizing people according to personal traits.

---

### 2. **Why doesn’t the Code of Excellence explicitly mention protected groups or identity factors?**

Our approach is:

* **Identity-blindness:** Personal characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion) are deemed irrelevant to collaboration.
* **Equal Opportunity:** By not listing any protected classes, we apply the same standard of respect to everyone.

If someone **does** discriminate on the basis of personal traits, that still violates our rule against personal attacks/harassment. Thus, the Code handles such misconduct without needing identity-based clauses.

---

### 3. **How does the Code of Excellence handle interpersonal conflicts or harassment, if it’s so merit-focused?**

Despite focusing on technical merit, we **do not** ignore interpersonal issues. We explicitly ban:

* Personal insults
* Harassment and stalking
* Sustained personal criticism unrelated to the code or project goals

If attempts at self-resolution fail, contributors can **report** via our documented process, and appropriate action (from warnings to expulsion) can be taken by the project’s leadership.

### 4. **What if a maintainer or the BDFL is biased (e.g., sexist or racist) and hides it?**

While we can’t control people’s private motivations, the Code of Excellence:

1. **Requires** all maintainers to justify decisions on **merit, not identity**.
2. **Prohibits** overt attacks based on personal attributes.
3. **Offers** a reporting process, with possible consequences if a maintainer demonstrates bias or breaks the CoC.
4. **Allows for forking** the project if dissatisfaction persists—an inherent freedom in open-source.

Ultimately, **sustained, unfairly applied bias** is a CoC violation. Community members can hold leaders accountable through open discussions, feedback, and forking if necessary.

---

### 5. **Isn’t a single BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life) governance approach risky?**

* **Minimal Bureaucracy:** The BDFL model is intentional, promoting fast decisions and minimal red tape.
* **Checks and Balances:** If contributors see repeated unfair rulings, they can address the BDFL, or raise concerns with other core maintainers. In extreme cases, they can fork the project.
* **Voluntary:** Open-source involvement is voluntary. The BDFL’s leadership must remain “benevolent” to keep contributors engaged.

We acknowledge that no system is perfect, but the BDFL model helps maintain a unified vision and quick resolution to conflicts.

---

### 6. **How does this Code accommodate contributors who want a more detailed list of rules?**

* **Flexible Base Document:** The Code of Excellence is meant to be **adaptable**. We encourage you to fork or amend it if your community prefers, for example, adding a small committee or more detailed examples of unacceptable behavior.
* **Core Principles First:** We value clarity and brevity over exhaustive rules. We believe a strong culture of **rationality, professionalism, and direct conflict resolution** is more effective than enumerating every edge case.

---

### 7. **Does this Code invite “toxic” people who’ve been rejected by projects with stricter CoCs?**

* **No Guarantee:** Any CoC (strict or minimal) can attract individuals who may have clashed elsewhere.
* **Behavior-Focused:** What matters is actual behavior here. If someone is “toxic” (harassing or disruptive), they can be removed. The Code clearly forbids personal attacks and harassment.
* **Merit and Respect:** If individuals join and adhere to our guidelines—focusing on technical work, rational discussion, and respect—they’re welcome.

---

### 8. **Can a “merit-first” philosophy still foster an inclusive environment?**

* **Yes:** By focusing on **what** someone contributes, not **who** they are, the Code naturally allows anyone (regardless of background) to earn respect and responsibility.
* **Explicit Ban on Harassment:** We do not tolerate discrimination or attacks on personal traits. The environment can be inclusive without enumerating identity categories.
* **Equal Opportunity:** Everyone is judged on the same criteria—code quality, helpful feedback, and constructive behavior.

---

### 9. **Don’t we need strict, detailed rules to keep the community safe?**

* **Culture Over Rules:** We believe a culture of **civil discourse** and objective collaboration is more effective long-term than an extensive rulebook.
* **Straightforward Guidelines:** Our CoC includes explicit bans on personal attacks, harassment, and repeated negativity. We’re not entirely “rule-free.”
* **Project Leadership:** The Code empowers leadership to act decisively if someone is disrupting the project, rather than relying on committees or lengthy formalities.

### 10. **What if I disagree strongly with the BDFL’s decisions or this CoC’s principles?**

You are free to:

1. **Propose Revisions:** Raise an issue or submit a PR to suggest changes to the Code.
2. **Discuss** concerns with the BDFL and maintainers.
3. **Fork** the project under its open-source license if you want to govern differently.

We emphasize that nobody is forced to stay under leadership or guidelines they disagree with; forking is a built-in remedy in open-source.

---

### 11. **How can I adapt the Code of Excellence to my project’s needs?**

* **Cloning or Forking:** Grab the original text from our repository.
* **Editing Governance Sections:** If you dislike the BDFL approach, remove or replace it with a small leadership council or democratic process.
* **Adjusting Reporting Protocols:** Expand or simplify the steps based on your community size and preference.
* **License & Attribution:** We recommend using a permissive license (e.g., CC0) so others can freely adopt and modify it.

---

### 12. **Where can I learn more about the principles behind the Code of Excellence?**

The Code of Excellence draws on discussions around:

* **Meritocratic Project Management:** “Code of Merit” or other apolitical, productivity-focused governance ideas.
* **Minimalist CoCs:** Balancing essential safeguards against harassment with minimal oversight.
* **Open-Source Freedom:** The ability to fork if irreconcilable differences arise.

# Code of Excellence Repository

Welcome to the **Code of Excellence** repository! This repo hosts an open-source, merit-focused, and productivity-centered Code of Conduct (CoC) that you can adopt for your own projects. Our Code of Excellence emphasizes:

1. **Rational Self-Interest** – Contributors collaborate for mutual benefit.
2. **Individual Responsibility & Excellence** – Everyone takes ownership of their work.
3. **Meritocracy** – Ideas are judged on technical merit, not personal identity.
4. **Freedom of Thought & Expression** – Technical discourse and debate are welcome when relevant.
5. **Respectful Collaboration** – Civility, on-topic feedback, and avoidance of personal attacks.

## Purpose of This Repository

* **Central Storage:** We keep the latest version of the Code of Excellence here, along with any alternate versions we develop.
* **Modular Variations:** We may experiment with different governance models (e.g., removing the “BDFL” requirement or adding committees for enforcement) to suit different projects’ needs.
* **Community Input & Discussion:** If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. Our goal is to maintain a constructive, flexible document that balances meritocracy with healthy communication.

## Contents

* **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`:** The primary document, providing a comprehensive outline of principles, expectations, governance, and enforcement guidelines.
* **`variations/`:** A folder where we place alternate versions (e.g., variations without a BDFL model, or simplified enforcement procedures).
* **`README.md`:** This file, explaining the purpose and usage of the repository.
